A machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a used car based on features like year, fuel type, transmission, and kilometers driven. Built using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Features:
Predict car prices using ML models
Compare Random Forest, SVR, KNN, and Stacking
Interactive Streamlit web app

Visualizations: 
predicted vs actual, residuals, feature importance

Tech Stack:
Python · scikit-learn · Streamlit · pandas · seaborn

Dataset:
Uses Cardetails.csv with features like year, present_price, fuel, kms_driven, etc.

Output:
Prediction from each model
Model performance table (R², MAE, MSE)
Graphs for comparison and analysis
